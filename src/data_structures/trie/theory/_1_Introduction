What is a TRIE Data Structure:

The Trie data structure is a tree-like data structure used for storing a dynamic set of strings.

It is commonly used for efficient retrieval and storage of keys in a large dataset.

The structure supports operations such as insertion, search, and deletion of keys, making it a valuable tool in fields like computer science and information retrieval.

    we have words such as
        Apple
        apps
        bac
        bat

    assuming all characters are lower case

    Trie class node looks like this.

    Trie{
        Trie a[26];
        boolean flag;
    }

    their will always be a root


Common Operations:
    Insertion
    Search
