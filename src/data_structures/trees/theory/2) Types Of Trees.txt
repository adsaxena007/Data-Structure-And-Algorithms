Types Of Trees

    1)  Binary Tree -
            A binary tree is a tree having at most 2 nodes

    2)  Binary Search Tree -
            A binary Search tree is a binary tree
                where left node value is always smaller than or equal to the root node.
                right node value is always greater than the node.

    3)  Complete Binary Tree -
            in a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled
            All nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.
