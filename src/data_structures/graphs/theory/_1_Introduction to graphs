Types Of Graphs:

    1) Undirected Graph
                N1 ---- N2
                |       |
                |       |
                |       |
                N3 ---- N4
                |       |
                |       |
                |       |
                |       |
                N5 ____ N6
                |       |
                |       |
                |       |
                |       |
                ----N7---

                N1,N2,....N7 are Nodes or Vertex
                No of nodes - 7

                Every node is connected by a line which is called an edge

                An undirected graph represents that an edge can be there in both directions

                Here we can go from N1 to N2 and N2 to N1

                Undirected graph means an edge is bi directional


    2) Directed Graph
                N1 ---> N2
                |       ^
                |       |
                |       |
                V       |
                N3 ---> N4
                |  <--- ^
                |       |
                |       |
                V       |
                N5      N6
                ^       ^
                |       |
                |       |
                |       |
                ----N7---

                N1,N2,....N7 are Nodes or Vertex
                No of nodes - 7

                Every node is connected by a line which is called an edge

                An directed graph represents that an edge can be there in one direction only

                Here we can go from N1 to N2

                Directed graph means an edge is in one direction only

                We can have another edge to go backwards Like in N3 to N4 and N4 to N3


Cycles in Graph:
    Cycle means if we start from a node and ends ups again at that node by following some path then it means there is a cycle in a graph
    A graph can or cannot have a cycle.
                    N1 ---> N2
                    |       ^
                    |       |
                    |       |
                    V       |
                    N3 ---> N4

                    N1 ---> N2
                    |
                    |
                    V
                    N3 ---> N4

    graph designed above have cycle
    but a tree is also a graph which do not have a cycle


Degree of a node in graph:
    Degree of a node in undirected graph
        is equal to the number of edges attached to a node.
                    N1 ---- N2
                    |       |
                    |       |
                    |       |
                    N3 ---- N4

        Here every node has a degree of 2

        Total degree of a graph = 2 * number of edges. (as every edge is connected to 2 nodes)


    Degree of a node in Directed graph:
        in Directed graph we have two types of degree
            1) In-degree of node:
                    it is the number of incoming edges

            2) Out-Degree of node:
                    it is the number of out-coming edges

Edge Weight:
    Every edge can have a weight
    if weight is not gives we assume edge weight as 1
