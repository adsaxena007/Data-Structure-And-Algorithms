You can say these are 4 different graphs, it is correct

But what if the question says
    given a graph with 10 nodes an 8 edges between them as shown above. traverse the graph.

    A B C D will be the components of graph.
    so to traverse every node of graph we take a visited array of N+1 length always


    Visited = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
    we start from Visited[1]
    for(int i=1;i<=n;i++{
        if(Visited[i] == 0)
               traverse(i);
        i++;
    }

    when we traverse i = 1
        Component A will be traversed
        Visited = [0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]

        Visited[1],Visited[2],Visited[3],Visited[4] will be marked as 1
        That is we have visited the N1,N2,N3,N4


    when we traverse i = 5
            Component B will be traversed

    when we traverse i = 8
                Component C will be traversed

    when we traverse i = 10
                Component D will be traversed
